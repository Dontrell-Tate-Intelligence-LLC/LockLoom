# LockLoom Secure Access Platform
> **Provisioning QR (Latest):** https://dontrell-tate-intelligence-llc.github.io/LockLoom/

LockLoom is a cross-platform (Android and iOS) mobile security solution that enforces biometric **and** PIN verification before users can unlock their devices or launch protected applications. Administrators can define per-app factor policies (including different biometric modalities and PINs), optionally hide protected apps behind LockLoom’s secure launcher folder with its own PIN policy, cloak LockLoom behind another app’s icon/name, require the LockLoom console itself to use every available biometric plus an 8-digit admin PIN, enforce timed re-authentication overlays that sever active sessions on failure, and receive geolocated email/SMS alerts (including SOS beacons) for access attempts, failures, configuration changes, and text-triggered distress/shutdown/photo-capture actions.

LockLoom supports silent SMS codewords—with three configurable phrases per action—for SOS beaconing, remote shutdown, forced photo capture, forced audio capture, and forced video capture. Forced photo workflows use both front and rear cameras (when present) and deliver the images to the secondary notification mailbox, while audio and video captures default to five-second clips (expandable to 30 seconds) before shipping encrypted evidence to the same destination. Failed authentication attempts automatically trigger the dual-camera photo capture and alert flow, ensuring evidence is gathered whenever policies are challenged.

The consumer app ships with an in-app walkthrough that guides buyers through Android Device Owner or iOS MDM-lite/TestFlight enrollment, captures consent for degraded coverage when management rights are refused, provisions carrier/CPaaS relays for mirrored SMS distress triggers, and documents silent SOS automation (radios auto-toggle without indicators, with an optional NFC tag/Bluetooth fob hardware kill switch). Users can require the kill switch’s presence for normal operation and, when absent, LockLoom immediately locks the device until the switch returns. Telemetry retention is capped at 30 days, stored as salted SHA-512 hashes under consumer-owned keys, and onboarding recommends dedicated Proton Mail accounts for alerts and key escrow.

LockLoom launches as a single consumer-tier SKU priced at a USD $4.99 lifetime purchase, with optional upgrades delivered via in-app unlocks while retaining enterprise manageability through configuration.
